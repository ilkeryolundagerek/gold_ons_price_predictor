# Gold-Ons Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict the prices of Gold-Ons using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for time series forecasting due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## Introduction

This project leverages historical data of Gold-Ons prices to train an LSTM model. The model can then be used to forecast future prices, which can be useful for investors and analysts.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the model for predicting future prices, you can run:

```bash
python predict.py
```

You can adjust the settings in the `config.json` file to suit your needs, including the length of the time series used for prediction, the number of epochs, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model includes historical prices of Gold-Ons. Ensure that the data is in the correct format before training the model. The dataset can be found in the `data/` directory.

## Model Architecture

The LSTM model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies in the data. The architecture includes:

- Input layer
- LSTM layers
- Dense layers for output

You can find the model architecture details in the `model.py` file.

## Training

To train the model, run:

```bash
python train.py
```

Ensure you have the dataset available in the correct directory. You can modify the training parameters in the `config.json` file.

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). Run the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

## Results

The model's predictions are compared against actual values to assess its accuracy. The results, including plots of predicted vs. actual prices, are saved in the `results/` directory.
